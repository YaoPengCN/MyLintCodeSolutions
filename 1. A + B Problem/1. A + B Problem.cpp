/** 
* 1. A + B Problem
* Difficulty
* Easy
* 
* Description
* Write a function that add two numbers A and B.
*
* Clarification
* Are a and b both 32-bit integers?
* Yes.
* 
* Can I use bit operation?
* Sure you can.
* 
* Example
* Given a=1 and b=2 return 3.
* 
* Challenge
* Of course you can just return a + b to get accepted. But Can you challenge not do it like that?(You should not use + or any arithmetic operators.)
